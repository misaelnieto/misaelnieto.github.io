## `Hello world!`

Thanks for reaching this part of my site! I am human too, so I do other things outside my daily job. Some things are technical, some are not. Here we go!

## I am happily married to _Xochitl_

Here is a photo of us

Aren't we cute?


## We live with 8 dogs

We love dogs. But there's a running joke about their names: Except for *Pulga* (flea in spanish), they are happily named after sweets and candies. For the sake of clarity Here's a table of their names, an english translation and an illustration of each sweet.
