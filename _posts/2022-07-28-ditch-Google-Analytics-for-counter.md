Nowadays GA is becoming quite complex for me; it looks so complex that I couldn't find a way to upgrade my blog to GA 4 and I got impatient, so I thought I could switch to something else.

I did some quick research and [Counter](https://counter.dev) was the most simple of all the alternatives. 

This blog is powered by Jekill and hosted on GitHub Pages (GH). I could not find any gem for Counter, so I copied `vendor/bundle/ruby/2.6.0/gems/bulma-clean-theme-0.13.1/_includes/google-analytics.html` to `_includes/google-analytics.html`, then I proceeded to comment out the GA code and pasted the tracking code generated by Counter.

That did the trick. And the stats from this blog are now on https://counter.dev/dashboard.html?user=nnieto&token=gOSb%2FNj1wbMAfG9C
