## My euolgy to Denis Ritchie

In Mexico you have to go to 6 years of elementary school, 3 for secondary and
another three of Bachelor/high-school just before you can get to the
University.

During my three years of high-school I was taught the C language. The first
paragraphs on my text book on C talked about Unix and some of the doings of
Kernigham, Ritchie and Thomson in the Bell Labs.

Once in the University, one of the first things that I did was to get a hold
of "The C programming language". I don't remember if it was on spanish or
english.

Nowadays I work as a Python programmer on Linux systems. And I enjoy it. So
thanks Dennis, and farewell.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main (int argc, char * argv[]) {
    printf ("Goodbye, world.\n");

    return 0;
}
```
