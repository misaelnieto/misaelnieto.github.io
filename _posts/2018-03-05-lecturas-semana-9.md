- [Economics of solar cells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP_wWHjvLBY). Right now wind power is the cheapest way to produce energy, but only on ground. Wind power on offshore is more expensive. Solar/PV cost is decreasing, but still costly enough now. But, for PV's, global installed capacity doubles every 2 or 3 years, and cost goes down for about 22%. PV's are good for peak hours, however it only has about of 1000 hours per year of operation whereas wind has 2000-3000 hours per year and a small decentralized power plant is between 4000~5000 operationa hr/year.
