GSOC 2018 - Week 1

Hi, my name is Noe Nieto, I live in Mexicali and I'm about to finish my master's degree on Instituto de Ingenier√≠a UABC Mexicali. My Thesis is about simulation of solar cells, so I felt like doing something related on my first GSOC, so I contacted Juan Sanchez from DevSim and asked whether he was interested to mentor me for the GSOC. After a couple of emails we came to the idea of enabling DevSim to simulate solar cells.
