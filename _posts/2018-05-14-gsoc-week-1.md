GSOC 2018 - Week 1

Introducing .. me:

Hi, my name is Noe Nieto, I live in Mexicali and I'm about to finish my master's degree on Instituto de Ingenier√≠a UABC Mexicali. My Thesis is about simulation of solar cells, so I felt like doing something related on my first GSOC, so I contacted Juan Sanchez from [DevSim](https://www.devsim.org/) and asked him whether he was interested to mentor me for the GSOC. After a couple of emails we came to the idea of enabling DevSim to simulate solar cells. The [project URL on the GSOC site.](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6392690430705664)

So, right now [DevSim already has some interesting features](https://github.com/devsim/devsim#software-features), but it does not have a way to simulate the response of semiconductors with incident light.s
