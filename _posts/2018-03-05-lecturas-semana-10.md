- [Bill Nye Shares Some Facts and Opinions on Marijuana](https://www.zmescience.com/science/bill-nye-marijuana-science-02032018/). Bill Nye pointed out it is possible, even perhaps likely, that the tendency to become addicted to cannabis has its roots in human **DNA**. He believes it is either present or not present, using alcoholism to back up his hypothesis. “Some people get addicted, some people don’t,” said Nye. “Some people get high, some people don’t.” The Science Guy concluded that cannabis is really a substance which requires our attention and a lot more studies before we can claim to truly understand its effects.

- [Silicon Nanocrystals for Superefficient Solar Cells](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/408475/silicon-nanocrystals-for-superefficient-solar-cells/). A typical solar cell generates only one electron per photon of incoming sunlight. Some exotic materials are thought to produce multiple electrons per photon, but for the first time, the same effect has been seen in silicon. Researchers showed that silicon nanocrystals can produce two or three electrons per photon of high-energy sunlight. By generating multiple electrons from high-energy photons, solar cells made of silicon nanocrystals could theoretically convert more than 40 percent of the energy in light into electrical power. This is only “one breakthrough out of maybe three or four” needed to produce cheap, superefficient solar cells.
