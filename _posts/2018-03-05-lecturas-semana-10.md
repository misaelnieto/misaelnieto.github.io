Bill Nye pointed out it is possible, even perhaps likely, that the tendency to become addicted to cannabis has its roots in human **DNA**. He believes it is either present or not present, using alcoholism to back up his hypothesis. “Some people get addicted, some people don’t,” said Nye. “Some people get high, some people don’t.” The Science Guy concluded that cannabis is really a substance which requires our attention and a lot more studies before we can claim to truly understand its effects.
