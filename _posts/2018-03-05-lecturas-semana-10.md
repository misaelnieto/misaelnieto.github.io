- [New tardigrade species with unusual eggs found in Japanese parking lot](https://www.zmescience.com/ecology/animals-ecology/new-tardigrade-japan-0432432/). No se, pero por alguna razón me acorde de la frase "_Never nuke a country twice_".
- [Bill Nye Shares Some Facts and Opinions on Marijuana](https://www.zmescience.com/science/bill-nye-marijuana-science-02032018/). Bill Nye pointed out it is possible, even perhaps likely, that the tendency to become addicted to cannabis has its roots in human **DNA**. He believes it is either present or not present, using alcoholism to back up his hypothesis. “Some people get addicted, some people don’t,” said Nye. “Some people get high, some people don’t.” The Science Guy concluded that cannabis is really a substance which requires our attention and a lot more studies before we can claim to truly understand its effects.

- This video is about physics of operation in multi junction solar cells. Talk given by Dr. Vijit Sabnis (Solar Junction) at Stanford University for EE 237: Solar Energy Conversion taught by Dr. Aneesh Nainani. [Link to video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxTXeXNeeIY)
- [Silicon Nanocrystals for Superefficient Solar Cells](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/408475/silicon-nanocrystals-for-superefficient-solar-cells/). A typical solar cell generates only one electron per photon of incoming sunlight. Some exotic materials are thought to produce multiple electrons per photon, but for the first time, the same effect has been seen in silicon. Researchers showed that silicon nanocrystals can produce two or three electrons per photon of high-energy sunlight. By generating multiple electrons from high-energy photons, solar cells made of silicon nanocrystals could theoretically convert more than 40 percent of the energy in light into electrical power. This is only “one breakthrough out of maybe three or four” needed to produce cheap, superefficient solar cells.

- [Astrophysicists have discovered](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180301094807.htm) how to control the 'micolensing' effects of strongly lensed Type 1a Supernovae with supercomputers at NERSC. Armed with this knowledge they believe they will be able to find 1,000 strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae in realtime from LSST data -- that's 20 times more than previous expectations. 
- [ The Principle of Electric Wind in Plasma](https://www.pddnet.com/news/2018/03/principle-electric-wind-plasma). Electric wind in plasma is a well-known consequence of interactions arising from collisions between charged particles (electrons or ions) and neutral particles. It refers to the flow of neutral gas that occurs when charged particles accelerate and collide with a neutral gas.
