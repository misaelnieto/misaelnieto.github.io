Parece que este año, el equipo técnico de iServices viajará al Pycon 2010 y
por eso me puse a hacer una lista de tutoriales que podrían ser de interés.

## Para el miércoles 17 de Febrero 2010

### Faster Python Programs through Optimization (Mike Müller)**

Although Python programs may be slow for certain types of tasks, there are
many different ways to improve performance. This tutorial will introduce
optimization strategies and demonstrate techniques to implement them.

Another of the objectives of this course is to give participants the ability
to decide what might be the optimal solution for a certain performance
problem. Participants are strongly recommended to bring laptops because all
techniques are introduced with examples and exercises.

### Your first BFG application (Carlos de la Guardia)**

BFG is a "pay only for what you eat" Python web framework. You can get started
easily and learn new concepts as you go, and only if you need them. It's
simple, well tested, well documented, and fast.

Though repoze.bfg web framework is inspired by Zope and uses concepts and
software that may be familiar to Zope programmers, no prior Zope experience is
required to use it. Also, unlike Zope, you don't need to understand many
concepts and technologies fully before you can be truly productive.

BFG is also inspired by Django and Pylons. It tries to learn valuable lessons
from things that have gone well with different web frameworks and give the
user great flexibility in applying them.

This course will present BFG and lead you through the creation of a wiki
application as the concepts from the framework are introduced. It can be
useful to newcomers to Python web development, Zope and Plone enthusiasts who
need a more minimalistic approach for some of their web development projects
or who just want a fresh start without losing all the experience gained in
Zope development. Also, developers from other frameworks who want to see how
things are done in the Zope world without being drowned in new concepts and
technologies might enjoy it.

### Test Driven Web Development (Travis Swicegood)**

Ever wonder how to unit test a web service? Do you struggle figuring out how
to test cross-browser tests for an website's AJAX interfaces? Think that Test
Driven Development is great for academics or programmers who don't have to
execute their programs in the real world, but have that nagging feeling that
at least some of the idioms of the traditional unit test apply to web
development?

This is the tutorial for you if you answered yes to any of those questions.
Test Driven Web Development pulls xUnit out of its abstract world and puts it
square in the middle of our every day lives as web developers. We start off
with the fundamentals of testing and progress rapidly through different types
of testing—unit, functional, acceptance, and even a bit of performance—and
demonstrate how you can use to make better, more extensible, more scalable
systems.

### Data Storage in Python - An Overview of Options (Mike Müller)

There are many possibilities in Python to store data.

This tutorials explores some of them: flat file, Excel files, NetCDF and HDF5,
serialization with pickle and friends, relational databases, bsddb and ZODB.

The objective of this course is to give the participants an overview over
available options as well as there advantages and disadvantages for different
purposes.

### A Long Pinax Tutorial (Daniel Greenfeld, James Tauber)

Pinax (<http://pinaxproject.com>) is a platform built on top of Django
(<http://djangoproject>) for rapidly developing websites.

This tutorial will instruct on Pinax installation, creating projects,
leveraging applications, modification of templates, Pinax specific settings,
media handling, deployment, how to contribute back to Pinax, and much more.

The goal of the tutorial is a working project that could be installed as a
professional level site.

The presenters are Pinax core developers and we'll run through lots of small,
practical hands-on examples. We will take questions throughout the tutorial.

## Para el Jueves 18 de Febrero del 2010

### Introduction to SQLAlchemy (Johnathan Ellis)

SQLAlchemy is the premier SQL toolkit for Python. SQLAlchemy exposes the full
power of SQL while remaining easy to use for the basics, and is flexible
enough to work with existing database schemas as well as fresh designs.
SQLAlchemy is used in production by leading Python web frameworks Pylons and
Turbogears as well as many other web and non-web developers.

This tutorial teaches SQLAlchemy's object-relational mapping to automate
painlessly loading and persisting objects from and to your database, even when
complex relationships exist.

### Django In Depth (James Bennett)

Most books, tutorials and other documentation for Django take a high-level
approach to its components and APIs, and so barely scratch the surface of the
framework. In this tutorial, however, we'll take a detailed look under the
hood, covering everything from the guts of the ORM to the innards of the
template system to how the admin interface really works.

Whether you're the newest of newbies or the most seasoned of application
developers, you'll come away with a deeper knowledge of Django, and a plethora
of new tips and tricks you can use in your own applications.

### Open Stack: Hacking the Social Web (David Recordon/Mike Malone)

In this tutorial we'll explain what the Open Stack is and how you can use
tools like OAuth, OpenID, and Portable Contacts to integrate your app with the
rest of the web. We'll cover each component in depth, and walk through example
Python implementations for a variety of scenarios
