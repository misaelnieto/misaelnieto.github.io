## Exercising the transfer matrix method "by pencil"

I'm attending a class on Electromagneting Wave Propagation in the Instituto de Ingenier√≠a, UABC Mexicali, with Dr. Carlos Villa Angulo. He kindly allowed me to go to the class altough i'm not currently enrolled as a graduate student. Here in Mexico we say that I'm attending as _"Listener (oyente)"_. I don't know the exact term used in english for this.

We are now in the 5th or 6th week of the course and we are now studying the Transfer Matrix Method to understand the propagation of electromagnetic waves (e.g. Light) through different layers of materials with different reflection and absoroption coefficients. There are a lot of applications for this method, and is one used to simulate the absorption of light in a solar cell with multple layers.

Since we are just a few people in the class room (9) the professor assigned a different device for each sudent and everyone must make a presentation and write a detailed report with the calculations made.

## The device

My device has 4 layers: ITO, a-Si-n, a-Si-p and Aluminum. Let's picture that with majestic detail using ASCI-Art:
