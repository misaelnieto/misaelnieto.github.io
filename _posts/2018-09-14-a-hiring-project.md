## A hiring project

I caught word that some company was hiring devs, so I decided to take the bait. I answered the first couple of riddles that ended up in a text with the requirements about a hiring project.

 I'll document the steps and decisions I made until the project was finished.

### The stack

After evaluating the trends I decided to use the following:

Backend: Django on AWS Lambda + API Gateway
Frontend: Vue.JS served from S3.
