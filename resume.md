## About me

Hi! My name is Noe Nieto, I've doing software development for the last 19 years.
I work mainly with Free/Libre/OpenSource software, though I use proprietary
software whenever its the right tool. I live in Baja California with my wife and
8 beautiful crossbreed dogs &#128021;.

**[Purism SPC](https://puri.sm/)** - *Web Developer for [Librem One](https://librem.one/)* 
:   - **Company description**: Purism is a Social Purpose Corporation, dedicated to freedom, privacy, and security.
    - **Activities**: During my time on Purism I worked integrating Wordpress and Woocommerce with our
        middleware running Django. Other small tasks and technologies included LDAP
        configuration, static sites with Jekyll and [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola),
        Continuous integration with Gitlab CI, PHPUnit, Python Virtualenv/Pipenv, Bash,
        Docker and Vagrant.
    - **Technologies used include**:: `PHP`, `PHPUnit`, `Wordpress`, `Django`, `Bash`, `Vagrant`.

**[Social Reality](https://srax.com/)** - *SRAX Web Developer*
:   - **Company description**: SR Enables public companies to track their investors’ behaviors and trends and
      use those insights to engage investors across marketing channels.
    - **Period**:November 2015 - August 2017
    - **Activities**: Working on SR was both fun a challenging. When I started, the company’s Ad
        exchange backend was the typical LAMP stack with a lot of legacy code on
        stored procedures and PHP/CodeIgniter code. Deployment process was
        completely manual and error prone.

        My first assignment was to streamline their somehow complex onboarding
        process, I wrote the backend using stored procedures and tested them using
        PHPUnit and a MySQL server running on a ramdisk.

        Their Real Time Bidding system relied on a proprietary algorithm written in
        C++. The developer had never worked on Linux before, so I helped him by
        configuring a proper sandbox server and wrote a tool that would pull the
        latest changes from SVN/Git, compile the code and restart the web server
        with a webhook or with the click of a button.
        
        At the end of my time on SR/SRAX the new onboarding process was finished, we
        had already integrated several ad exchanges into our backend (a huge
        milestone), the team migrated from SVN to Git, we started to write tests
        with PHPUnit and Selenium and the developer’s development enviroment was now
        semi automated using a customized version of Puphpet, (code named Arale) and
        the whole team was already using Agile methodologies. Besides the developer
        role, I also enjoyed administering some of Linux servers with Puppet and
        staring to New Relics graphs.
    - **Technologies used include**: `PHP`/`CodeIgniter`, the `LAMP` stack, `C++`, `Jira`, `NewRelic`.

        optimization and emergency response for SQL Server databases, IIS, and Linux
        hosts for ftp/sftp, web and backup systems, all integrated into the
        company’s Active Directory server. I was in charge of monitoring all the
        changes pushed by the developers; Our Database load had high concurrency and
        I had to look for naive queries that otherwise would trash the DB server.
        Also since database sizes typically exceeded Terabytes, we had to be a bit
        extra careful for backups. Some of the SQL Servers had HA configurations
        like replicas and Always On. Also, I had the chance to work on internal
        tools using `ASP` `.NET MVC.`, `AWS S3`, `VMWare`, `Python` and `RabbitMQ`.

        (using ZODB, a NoSQL) until the JS code became difficult to maintain; to
        escape our doom we migrated to another stack: Python, Pyramid and SQL
        Alchemy with a good JSON API on the backend, and Angular.js 1.x on the
        frontend. Additionally, I managed the Linux servers on AWS.

## Education

**[Google Summer of Code 2018](https://bit.ly/3zIOv69)**
:   - I did the Google Summer of Code on 2008!
    - **Period**: May - August, 2018
    - **Activities**: My master's degree thesis was about solar cells so I choosed [DEVSIM](https://devsim.org/).
        DEVSIM is a TCAD (Technology Computer Aided Design) semiconductor
        device simulation software. TCAD tools are special simulation
        software that can simulate the fabrication process of semiconductors
        as well as their operation. The objective of this work was to add the
        necessary improvements to DEVSIM so it could simulate solar cells.
    - **Technologies used include**: `Python`, and the [DEVSIM](https://devsim.org/) TCAD.

        fabrication solar cells using Crystaline Silicon as substrate with Boron and
        Phosphorus as dopants using diffusion or ion implantation. Besides earning
        my degree, I used this knowledge to work on 2018 edition of Google's Summer
        of Code with the project "[Enable DEVSIM to simulate solar
        cells](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6310236080046080/)"
